      <p>
        Plenty of space is the luxury of choosing your house or land today on
        any planet in the solar system. In view of the ever-increasing
        population, we offer a radical but clearly avant-garde solution. Use the
        gauge to set the temperature, gravity and exposure of your choice (+
        duration of a day or other) and embark on the adventure of Plenty of
        space. Our calculation engine is made up of a high-performance
        algorithmic chain that will quickly find your tailor-made paradise.
        After finding your planet, follow the directions to find your haven of
        peace there, but beware of surprises...
